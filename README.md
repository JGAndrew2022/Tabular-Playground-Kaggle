# Tabular-Playground-Kaggle
Kaggle competition hosted in January of 2022. I placed in the top 25% of competitors.

**Description**

We've heard your feedback from the 2021 Tabular Playground Series, and now Kaggle needs your help going forward in 2022!

There are two (fictitious) independent store chains selling Kaggle merchandise that want to become the official outlet for all things Kaggle. We've decided to see if the Kaggle community could help us figure out which of the store chains would have the best sales going forward. So, we've collected some data and are asking you to build forecasting models to help us decide.

Help us figure out whether KaggleMart or KaggleRama should become the official Kaggle outlet!

There are four files in this repository. The first contains the final gradient boost algorithm to train and generate preditions. The other files contain various gradient boost models, such as AdaBoost and XGBoost, optimized using Optuna.
